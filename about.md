Hi, I’m Lauris Dziļums, a full-stack software developer with over ten years of experience.
I enjoy building reliable, scalable systems based on simple, solid principles.
I love working with Scala, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Rust, usually alongside PostgreSQL.

In earlier years, I did quite a bit of client work with PHP and MySQL (the good old dog days).

I’ve worked on engineering teams at large-scale companies, including a major crypto exchange, and have also built a few startups.

Startups and projects I’m proud of:

* **[Calmer](https://gocalmer.com/)** – Anxiety and panic attack relief app
* **[StockMarketGame.net](https://stockmarketgame.net)** – Mobile trading simulator and interactive school to learn about stock market
* [BitcoinHero](https://bitcoinhero.me) – Free Bitcoin trading simulator
* [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com) – MySQL and PostgreSQL GUI database tool
* [Sensei Grid](https://datazenit.com/static/sensei-grid/examples/index.html) – Lightweight data grid library used in Datazenit
* [Awesome Scala](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala) –  List of awesome Scala libraries
* Hiburo – Lightweight team management web app (deprecated)
* GetSSL.me – The fastest way to get SSL certificates for a reasonable price (deprecated)
