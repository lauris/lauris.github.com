I am **Lauris Dziļums**, a software developer who enjoys exploring
new technologies and programming languages. I have developed various
projects in Scala, Python, PHP, JavaScript and
a few other languages. I am founded [Datazenit](http://datazenit.com),
a startup that is building web-based database administration tool for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Datazenit is where
I spend most of my time, but I also enjoy going on a trip with my bike,
fishing after a long day's work or just building stuff for fun.
